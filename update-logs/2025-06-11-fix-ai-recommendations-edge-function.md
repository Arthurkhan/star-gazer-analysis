# Fix AI Recommendations Edge Function Error - 2025-06-11

## Overview
Fixed the 500 Internal Server Error occurring when calling the AI recommendations edge function. The issue was caused by the edge function returning a 500 status code with fallback data, which the Supabase functions client couldn't handle properly.

## Objectives
- Fix the edge function error preventing AI recommendations from working
- Ensure fallback recommendations are properly returned when OpenAI API fails
- Improve error handling and user feedback

## Files Modified/Created

### ðŸ”„ MODIFIED FILES:
- `supabase/functions/generate-recommendations/index.ts` - Changed to always return 200 status code with error info in response body
- `src/services/recommendationService.ts` - Updated to handle new response format and check for errors in response data

## Changes Made

### 1. Edge Function Response Handling
- Modified edge function to always return HTTP 200 status
- Moved error information into the response body alongside fallback recommendations
- This ensures the Supabase client properly receives and processes the response data

### 2. Frontend Service Updates
- Updated recommendationService to check response data for errors instead of relying on HTTP status
- Improved error detection and handling for various API failure scenarios
- Ensured fallback recommendations are properly used when OpenAI API is unavailable

## Technical Details
- The Supabase functions client treats any non-2xx status as an error and doesn't properly handle response bodies for error statuses
- By always returning 200 and including error info in the body, we ensure proper data flow
- Fallback recommendations now work correctly when OpenAI API fails
- No breaking changes - the fix is backward compatible

## Success Criteria: âœ…
- âœ… Edge function no longer returns 500 errors
- âœ… Fallback recommendations work when OpenAI API fails
- âœ… Proper error messages are shown to users
- âœ… AI recommendations feature is functional again

## Next Steps
- Deploy the updated edge function to Supabase using `supabase functions deploy generate-recommendations`
- Monitor for any additional edge cases or error scenarios
- Consider implementing caching for successful recommendations to reduce API calls
