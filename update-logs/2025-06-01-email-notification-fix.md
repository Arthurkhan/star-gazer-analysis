# Email Notification Fix - 2025-06-01

## Overview
Fixed the email notification feature by creating the missing `email_settings` table in the database. The error "relation 'public.email_settings' does not exist" was occurring because the table was never created in the database schema.

## Objectives
- ✅ Create the missing email_settings table
- ✅ Fix database errors when accessing notifications tab
- ✅ Enable email notification functionality
- ✅ Maintain existing application structure and functionality

## Files Modified/Created

### 🆕 NEW FILES:
- `supabase/migrations/20250601000000_create_email_settings_table.sql` - Database migration to create email_settings table

### 🔄 MODIFIED FILES:
None - Only added the migration file

### 🗑️ DELETED FILES:
None

## Changes Made

### 1. Created Email Settings Table Migration
- Added comprehensive migration file that creates the `email_settings` table
- Table structure includes:
  - `id` (UUID primary key)
  - `business_name` (unique identifier for each business)
  - `enabled` (boolean for toggling notifications)
  - `recipient` (email address)
  - `schedules` (JSONB for weekly, monthly, urgent notification settings)
  - `content` (JSONB for content preferences)
  - `created_at` and `updated_at` timestamps
- Added index on business_name for performance
- Implemented automatic updated_at trigger
- Configured Row Level Security (RLS) policies
- Granted necessary permissions to all user roles
- Pre-populated table with default entries for all three businesses

## Technical Details
- The migration uses JSONB columns for flexible storage of schedule and content preferences
- RLS is enabled but currently allows all operations (can be restricted later)
- The trigger automatically updates the `updated_at` timestamp on any row update
- Default values ensure backward compatibility

## Success Criteria: ✅
- ✅ Email settings table created successfully
- ✅ Database errors resolved
- ✅ Email notification form loads without errors
- ✅ Settings can be saved and retrieved
