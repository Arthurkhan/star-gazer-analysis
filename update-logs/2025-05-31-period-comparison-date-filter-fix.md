# Period Comparison Date Filtering Fix - 2025-05-31

## Overview
Fixed the period comparison feature to properly filter reviews by date range at the database level, supporting both legacy and normalized table structures.

## Objectives
- Fix date filtering that was returning all 1385 reviews regardless of date range
- Support legacy business-named tables with proper SQL date filtering
- Maintain backward compatibility with normalized table structure
- Ensure period comparison shows correct data for selected time periods

## Files Modified/Created

### ðŸ†• NEW FILES:
- `src/services/legacyReviewService.ts` - New service for handling legacy table queries with date filtering

### ðŸ”„ MODIFIED FILES:
- `src/hooks/useDashboardData.ts` - Updated to detect and support both legacy and normalized table structures

## Changes Made

### 1. Legacy Review Service
- Created `fetchLegacyReviewsWithDateFilter` function that properly applies date filtering at the SQL level
- Added `checkTableExists` to detect if legacy tables are in use
- Implemented `fetchAllLegacyReviewsWithDateFilter` to fetch from multiple legacy tables with date range support
- Fixed date column name inconsistency (`publishedAtDate` vs `publishedatdate`)

### 2. Dashboard Data Hook Enhancement
- Added automatic detection of database structure (legacy vs normalized)
- Modified `loadAllData` to use appropriate service based on detected structure
- Fixed date filtering to work at database level instead of client-side
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing normalized table structure

## Technical Details
- **Issue**: Date filtering was happening client-side after fetching all reviews
- **Root Cause**: The system was fetching all data first, then filtering in JavaScript
- **Solution**: Implemented proper SQL date filtering using `gte` and `lte` operators on the date columns
- **Legacy Support**: Detects and handles legacy business-named tables (e.g., "The Little Prince Cafe" table)

## Success Criteria: âœ…
- âœ… Date filtering now works at database level
- âœ… Period comparison shows correct review counts for each period
- âœ… Both legacy and normalized table structures are supported
- âœ… No breaking changes to existing functionality

## Next Steps
- Test the period comparison feature with the debug tool
- Verify that date ranges return appropriate review counts
- Consider migrating legacy tables to normalized structure in the future
- Remove debug tab once period comparison is verified working
