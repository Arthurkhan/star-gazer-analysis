# Average Rating Fix for Monthly Review Chart - 2025-06-13

## Overview
Fixed the issue with the average rating calculation on the monthly review chart. The chart was displaying random values between 4.0 and 4.5 instead of calculating actual average ratings from the review data.

## Objectives
- Calculate real average ratings for each month based on actual review stars
- Remove placeholder/random values from the chart
- Ensure accurate data visualization for business insights

## Files Modified/Created

### ðŸ”„ MODIFIED FILES:
- `src/utils/reviewDataUtils.ts` - Updated getChartData function to calculate average ratings
- `src/types/reviews.ts` - Added avgRating field to MonthlyReviewData interface
- `src/components/ReviewsChart.tsx` - Removed random calculation, uses actual data

### ðŸ†• NEW FILES:
- `update-logs/2025-06-13-avg-rating-fix.md` - This update log

## Changes Made

### 1. getChartData Function Enhancement
- Modified the function to track both count and sum of ratings for each month
- Added calculation of average rating per month: `totalRating / reviewsWithRating`
- Results are formatted to 2 decimal places for clean display
- Handles cases where reviews might not have ratings

### 2. Type Definition Update
- Added `avgRating?: number` field to MonthlyReviewData interface
- Made the field optional to maintain backward compatibility

### 3. ReviewsChart Component Cleanup
- Removed the random calculation: `4 + (Math.random() * 0.5)`
- Component now uses the avgRating data directly from getChartData
- Simplified the chartData useMemo hook

## Technical Details
- The fix ensures that each month's average rating is calculated from actual review stars
- Empty months or months without ratings will show 0 instead of random values
- Performance is maintained through existing caching mechanisms in getChartData
- No breaking changes - the fix is backward compatible

## Success Criteria: âœ…
- âœ… Average ratings are calculated from actual review data
- âœ… Random values are removed from the chart
- âœ… Chart displays accurate monthly average ratings
- âœ… No regression in existing functionality

## Next Steps
- Monitor the chart to ensure data accuracy
- Consider adding data validation for star ratings (ensure values are 1-5)
- Could add tooltip enhancements to show rating distribution per month
- Test with different date ranges to ensure consistency
