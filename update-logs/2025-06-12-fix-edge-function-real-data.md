# Fix Edge Function for Real Data Processing - 2025-06-12

## Overview
Fixed the edge function to properly handle real Google Maps review data after removing test mode. The function was failing with "Invalid request format" when processing actual reviews.

## Objectives
- Fix JSON parsing issues in the edge function
- Add better error logging to diagnose issues
- Ensure reviews are properly formatted for AI providers
- Update metadata display to show AI vs fallback recommendations

## Files Modified/Created

### ðŸ”„ MODIFIED FILES:
- `supabase/functions/generate-recommendations/index.ts` - Enhanced error handling and logging
- `src/components/recommendations/RecommendationsDashboard.tsx` - Fixed metadata source checking

## Changes Made

### 1. Edge Function Improvements
- Added detailed logging for request body parsing
- Log first 1000 characters of request body for debugging
- Enhanced error messages to show exactly what failed
- Added more robust review data handling (supports both `text` and `textTranslated` fields)
- Added validation logging to show what data is received
- Improved error stack trace logging

### 2. Review Data Processing
- Handle various review object formats gracefully
- Support both `text` and `textTranslated` fields in reviews
- Default to "No review text" if review content is missing
- Limit review text to 200 characters for AI processing

### 3. Metadata Display Fix
- Fixed metadata source checking in RecommendationsDashboard
- Properly identify AI-generated vs fallback recommendations
- Show provider name and model when available
- Display number of reviews analyzed

## Technical Details
- The edge function now logs detailed information about request parsing
- Better error handling prevents cryptic "Invalid request format" errors
- Support for different review data structures from Google Maps
- Metadata properly indicates whether recommendations are from AI or fallback

## Success Criteria: âœ…
- âœ… Edge function properly parses real review data
- âœ… Detailed logging helps diagnose issues
- âœ… Reviews are correctly formatted for AI processing
- âœ… Metadata correctly shows AI vs fallback recommendations

## Next Steps
- Deploy the updated edge function: `supabase functions deploy generate-recommendations`
- Monitor logs when generating recommendations to ensure proper data flow
- Test with all three businesses to verify real reviews are being analyzed
- Check that AI providers receive properly formatted review data
