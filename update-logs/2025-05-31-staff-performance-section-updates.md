# Staff Performance Section Updates - 2025-05-31

## Overview
Updated the Staff Performance Insights section display order and added scrollable functionality for better usability when there are many staff members mentioned in reviews.

- Add scrollable functionality when more than 6 staff members are displayed
- Improve user experience for viewing extensive staff lists

### üîÑ MODIFIED FILES:
- `src/components/analysis/StaffInsightsSection.tsx` - Added ScrollArea component and logic for scrollable staff list
- `src/components/analysis/AnalysisSummary.tsx` - Reordered sections to move Staff Insights after Performance Metrics

### üÜï NEW FILES:
- None

### üóëÔ∏è DELETED FILES:

## Changes Made

### 1. Added Scrollable Staff List (`StaffInsightsSection.tsx`)
- Imported ScrollArea component from UI library
- Added conditional rendering logic:
  - If 6 or fewer staff members: displays all without scroll
  - If more than 6 staff members: displays in a 500px height ScrollArea
- Added text indicator showing total number of staff members when scrollable
- Maintained the same card structure and styling for both scenarios

### 2. Reordered Analysis Sections (`AnalysisSummary.tsx`)
- Moved the 'staff-insights' section definition in the renderMainContent function
- New order is now:
  1. Executive Summary
  2. Performance Metrics
  3. **Staff Insights** (moved from position 5)
  4. Sentiment Analysis
  5. Thematic Analysis
  6. Operational Insights
  7. Action Items
- Updated comment to indicate the section was moved

## Technical Details
- Used shadcn/ui's ScrollArea component for smooth scrolling
- Set fixed height of 500px for the scrollable area
- Added padding-right (pr-4) to the ScrollArea for better scroll bar spacing
- Conditional rendering ensures no unnecessary scroll wrapper for small staff lists
- No performance impact as the component only renders what's visible in the viewport

## Success Criteria: ‚úÖ
- ‚úÖ Staff Performance Insights now appears directly after Performance Metrics
- ‚úÖ Staff lists with more than 6 members are scrollable
- ‚úÖ Staff lists with 6 or fewer members display normally without scroll
- ‚úÖ Visual indicator shows when viewing all staff members in scrollable view

## Next Steps
- Monitor user feedback on the new section order
- Consider adding a search/filter function for staff members if lists get very long
- Potential to add sorting options (by performance score, mentions, etc.)
