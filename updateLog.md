## 2025-05-21: Fixed Circular Dependencies Causing Infinite Loop

### Root Cause Analysis
After careful investigation, we identified the core issue causing the infinite loop:

1. **Circular Dependency Cycle**:
   - `useDashboardData` ➡️ passed `reviewData` to ➡️ `useBusinessSelection`
   - `useBusinessSelection` had an effect that triggered on `reviewData` changes
   - This effect updated `businessData` using `setBusinessData`
   - `fetchNextPage` in `useDashboardData` depended on `setBusinessData` and `reviewData`
   - When `fetchNextPage` updated `reviewData`, it triggered the whole cycle again

2. **Cascading State Updates**:
   - Every business selection change triggered a data fetch
   - Every data fetch updated `reviewData`
   - Updated `reviewData` triggered `useBusinessSelection` effects
   - Which then triggered more state updates and re-renders

3. **Missing Safeguards**:
   - No proper reference tracking to prevent concurrent fetches
   - No dependency control in critical effect hooks
   - Excessive auto-pagination triggering recursive data fetches

### Completed Improvements

3. **Optimized State Management**
   - Used `useMemo` to cache expensive calculations
   - Added conditional rendering based on active tab
   - Separated data fetching from state updates
   - Added cleanup for effects with destructive operations
