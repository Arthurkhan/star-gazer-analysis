- âœ… Forms prevent zoom on input focus
- âœ… Charts readable on small screens
- âœ… Tables convert to card layout on mobile
- âœ… Modals and dialogs fit mobile viewport
- âœ… Performance optimized for mobile devices

## Next Steps
- Test on various real devices (iOS and Android)
- Implement offline functionality with service workers
- Add pull-to-refresh functionality
- Consider native app wrapper (Capacitor/React Native)
- Optimize bundle splitting for mobile
- Add mobile-specific onboarding flow

4. Verify iOS safe areas on devices with notch
5. Test landscape orientation handling
6. Verify form behavior (no zoom on focus)
7. Test with screen readers (VoiceOver/TalkBack)
8. Verify performance on low-end devices
