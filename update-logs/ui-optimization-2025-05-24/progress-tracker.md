## 🚧 **Issues & Blockers**

### Current Issues
*None identified*

### Resolved Issues
*None - Phase 1 completed without any blockers*

---

## 📝 **Key Decisions Made**

1. **Project Structure**: Created dedicated folder for tracking across sessions
2. **Implementation Order**: Decided to start with removals before restructuring
3. **Scope**: Confirmed Review Pattern removal only from Overview tab, not globally
4. **Quality**: Emphasis on testing each phase before moving to next
5. **Customer Loyalty removal**: Low-risk due to placeholder implementation
6. **Review Pattern removal**: NO-OP (nothing to remove from Overview)
7. **Phase 1 approach**: Minimal, surgical changes to maintain stability

---

## 🔍 **Key Files Modified in Phase 1**

### ✅ **Successfully Modified Files:**
- **`src/utils/analysisUtils.ts`** - Removed customerLoyalty placeholder object
  - Removed: `customerLoyalty: { repeatReviewers: 0, loyaltyScore: 0 }`
  - Impact: Clean removal of unused placeholder code
  - Risk: None - feature was unimplemented

### ✅ **Files Investigated (No Changes Needed):**
- **`src/components/analysis/OperationalInsightsSection.tsx`** - No Customer Loyalty UI found
- **`src/types/analysisSummary.ts`** - Uses simplified structure, no conflicts
- All secondary files checked - no additional cleanup required
