# Browser AI Removal - 2025-06-11

## Overview
Removed all browser-based AI functionality and related files to clean up the codebase. The application now exclusively uses API-based AI providers (OpenAI, Claude, Gemini).

## Objectives
- Remove all browser AI related files that were causing issues
- Simplify the codebase by keeping only API-based AI functionality
- Eliminate the problematic BrowserAIService and web worker files

## Files Modified/Created

### üóëÔ∏è DELETED FILES:
- `src/services/ai/BrowserAIService.ts` - Main browser AI service class
- `src/services/ai/browserAI.ts` - Browser AI module
- `src/services/ai/browserAIService.ts` - Duplicate browser AI service
- `src/services/ai/ai-worker.js` - AI worker JavaScript file
- `src/services/ai/aiWorker.ts` - AI worker TypeScript file
- `src/services/ai/worker.ts` - Generic worker file
- `src/workers/aiProcessing.worker.ts` - AI processing web worker

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed Browser AI Implementation
- Deleted all browser-based AI files that used web workers
- Removed Transformers.js based implementation
- Eliminated the dual AI system complexity

### 2. Kept API-Based AI Providers
- OpenAI provider remains functional
- Claude provider remains functional 
- Gemini provider remains functional
- AI Service Factory continues to work with API providers only

## Technical Details
- The main `recommendationService.ts` was already using only API-based AI via Supabase edge functions
- No imports of browser AI were found in active components
- The AI Service Factory (`aiServiceFactory.ts`) only manages API providers
- No breaking changes to existing functionality

## Success Criteria: ‚úÖ
- ‚úÖ All browser AI files removed
- ‚úÖ No broken imports or references
- ‚úÖ Application continues to work with API-based AI only
- ‚úÖ Cleaner codebase without problematic web worker files

## Next Steps
- Continue using API-based AI providers exclusively
- No need to maintain browser-based AI code
- Focus on improving API-based AI functionality
