## 🔄 **Current Phase: Phase 1 - Content Removal & Cleanup**

### Task Progress
- [x] **Task 1.1**: Search and identify all Customer Loyalty components ✅ **COMPLETE**
- [x] **Task 1.2**: Search and identify Review Pattern in Overview context ✅ **COMPLETE**
- [ ] **Task 1.3**: Remove Customer Loyalty components 🔄 **NEXT**
- [ ] **Task 1.4**: ~~Remove Review Pattern from Overview~~ ⏭️ **SKIP - Nothing to remove**
- [ ] **Task 1.5**: Clean up and test

### Notes for Current Session
1. **Next Task**: Task 1.3 - Remove Customer Loyalty components
2. **Target Files for Removal**: 
   - `src/components/analysis/OperationalInsightsSection.tsx` (main UI component)
   - `src/utils/analysisUtils.ts` (placeholder logic)
3. **Key Discovery**: Review Pattern is NOT used in Overview context (Task 1.4 becomes NO-OP)
4. **Progress**: Ahead of schedule - Tasks 1.1 + 1.2 completed in 40 min vs estimated 60-90 min

### ⚠️ **Important Discovery**
**Review Pattern does NOT need removal from Overview context** - the PatternAnalysisView component exists but is not used in Overview-related files. This simplifies Phase 1 significantly.

## 📝 **Key Decisions Made**

1. **Project Structure**: Created dedicated folder for tracking across sessions
2. **Implementation Order**: Decided to start with removals before restructuring
3. **Scope**: Confirmed Review Pattern removal only from Overview tab, not globally
4. **Quality**: Emphasis on testing each phase before moving to next
5. **NEW**: Customer Loyalty removal is low-risk due to placeholder implementation
6. **NEW**: Review Pattern removal from Overview is NO-OP (nothing to remove)
