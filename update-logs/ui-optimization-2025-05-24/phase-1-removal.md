- **Started:** Not yet
- **Completed:** Not yet
- **Progress:** 0%

## üéØ **Objectives**
1. Remove Customer Loyalty feature completely from the application

## ‚úÖ **Task Breakdown**

### **Task 1.1: Search and Identify Customer Loyalty Components**
- **Status:** üî¥ **NOT STARTED**
- **Assigned:** Next session
- **Estimated:** 20-30 minutes

#### Sub-tasks:
- [ ] Search codebase for "customer loyalty" (case-insensitive)
- [ ] Search codebase for "Customer Loyalty" 
- [ ] Search codebase for "customerLoyalty" (camelCase)
- [ ] Search codebase for "loyalty" in component/file names
- [ ] Document all files containing Customer Loyalty references
- [ ] Analyze dependencies and usage patterns
- [ ] Create removal plan to avoid breaking dependencies

#### Expected Locations to Check:
- `src/components/` (all subdirectories)
- `src/utils/` (data utilities, analytics)
- `src/services/` (business logic)
- `src/types/` (type definitions)
- `src/hooks/` (custom hooks)

#### Documentation Format:
```
File: [filepath]
References Found: [list of references]
Usage Type: [component/utility/type/other]
Dependencies: [what depends on this]
Removal Impact: [assessment of removal impact]
```

### **Task 1.2: Search and Identify Review Pattern in Overview Context**
- **Status:** üî¥ **NOT STARTED**
- **Estimated:** 15-20 minutes

#### Sub-tasks:
- [ ] Check `src/components/dashboard/AllReviewsContent.tsx`
- [ ] Check `src/components/OverviewSection.tsx`
- [ ] Check `src/components/analysis/AnalysisSummary.tsx`
- [ ] Search for "review pattern", "Review Pattern", "reviewPattern"
- [ ] Document specific sections that contain review pattern analysis
- [ ] Verify pattern analysis exists in other contexts (monthly, etc.)
- [ ] Plan surgical removal from Overview only

#### Key Areas to Examine:
- AnalysisSummary component sections
- Any charts or visualizations showing pattern analysis
- Text/descriptions mentioning review patterns
- Data processing functions specific to patterns

### **Task 1.3: Remove Customer Loyalty Components**
- **Status:** üî¥ **NOT STARTED**
- **Estimated:** 30-45 minutes

#### Sub-tasks:
- [ ] Remove Customer Loyalty components (based on 1.1 findings)
- [ ] Remove imports of Customer Loyalty components
- [ ] Update parent components that reference Customer Loyalty
- [ ] Remove Customer Loyalty types/interfaces
- [ ] Remove Customer Loyalty utility functions
- [ ] Update any configuration/constants
- [ ] Remove Customer Loyalty test files (if any)

#### Removal Checklist:
- [ ] Component files deleted
- [ ] Import statements removed
- [ ] Type definitions removed
- [ ] Utility functions removed
- [ ] Parent component references updated
- [ ] No console errors after removal
- [ ] Application builds successfully

### **Task 1.4: Remove Review Pattern from Overview**
- **Status:** üî¥ **NOT STARTED**
- **Estimated:** 20-30 minutes

#### Sub-tasks:
- [ ] Remove review pattern sections from Overview components
- [ ] Update layout to account for removed content
- [ ] Ensure pattern analysis remains in other contexts
- [ ] Update any related data processing
- [ ] Fix any layout/spacing issues from removal

#### Specific Targets:
- Remove pattern visualization/charts from Overview
- Remove pattern text analysis from Overview
- Keep pattern analysis in Monthly reports (if exists)
- Maintain pattern analysis in AI recommendations (if exists)

### **Task 1.5: Clean up and Test**
- **Status:** üî¥ **NOT STARTED**
- **Estimated:** 15-20 minutes

#### Sub-tasks:
- [ ] Remove any unused imports
- [ ] Fix TypeScript compilation errors
- [ ] Remove dead code (if any)
- [ ] Test application build process
- [ ] Test basic navigation and functionality
- [ ] Verify no console errors
- [ ] Check responsive design still works
- [ ] Run any existing tests

#### Testing Checklist:
- [ ] `npm run build` succeeds
- [ ] `npm run dev` starts without errors
- [ ] Dashboard loads without errors
- [ ] Overview tab loads and displays correctly
- [ ] No Customer Loyalty features visible
- [ ] Review Pattern not visible in Overview
- [ ] Other tabs still function normally
- [ ] No console warnings/errors

## üö® **Potential Issues & Mitigation**

### Expected Challenges:
1. **Deep Integration**: Customer Loyalty might be deeply integrated into analysis components
   - **Mitigation**: Carefully trace dependencies before removal

2. **Shared Components**: Components might be used in multiple contexts
   - **Mitigation**: Create replacement components if needed

3. **Data Dependencies**: Removal might affect data processing pipelines
   - **Mitigation**: Update data processing to skip loyalty calculations

4. **Type Dependencies**: TypeScript types might be widely used
   - **Mitigation**: Replace with appropriate alternative types

### Risk Assessment:
- **Low Risk**: Removing standalone Customer Loyalty components
- **Medium Risk**: Updating shared analysis components
- **High Risk**: Breaking data processing or causing type errors
