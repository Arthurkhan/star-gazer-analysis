## 📦 Phase 1: Code Consolidation (3-5 days)

**Status**: ⚪ NOT STARTED  
**Goal**: Consolidate duplicate functionality and simplify codebase

### Task List:

#### 1. Consolidate Logging Systems
- [ ] Analyze usage of all logging systems:
  - [ ] `src/utils/logger.ts`
  - [ ] `src/utils/debugger.ts`
  - [ ] `src/services/logging/loggingService.ts`
- [ ] Choose one logging approach (recommend keeping `logger.ts`)
- [ ] Replace all other logging with chosen approach
- [ ] Delete redundant logging files
- [ ] Update all imports

#### 2. Consolidate Performance Monitoring
- [ ] Analyze performance utilities:
  - [ ] `src/utils/performanceOptimizations.ts`
  - [ ] `src/utils/performanceMetrics.ts`
  - [ ] `PerformanceMonitor` class usage
- [ ] Create single `performanceUtils.ts` with essential functions
- [ ] Remove over-engineered memoization (keep only >16ms operations)
- [ ] Delete redundant performance files
- [ ] Update all imports

#### 3. Simplify Error Handling
- [ ] Review `src/utils/errorHandling.ts` (11KB of complexity)
- [ ] Simplify to basic error types and logging
- [ ] Rely on React Query error handling where possible
- [ ] Reduce ErrorBoundary levels to single app-level boundary
- [ ] Remove excessive try-catch blocks

#### 4. Consolidate Safe Access Patterns
- [ ] Review all safe access utilities:
  - [ ] `src/utils/safeAccess.ts`
  - [ ] `src/utils/storage/safeStorage.ts`
- [ ] Create single safe access utility
- [ ] Use optional chaining (?.) where appropriate
- [ ] Remove redundant null checks

#### 5. TypeScript Simplification
- [ ] Review over-typed interfaces in:
  - [ ] `src/types/analysisSummary.ts` (17 interfaces → 3-4)
  - [ ] Other type files with excessive interfaces
- [ ] Use TypeScript inference more
- [ ] Remove redundant type definitions
- [ ] Consolidate similar types

### Verification Checklist:
- [ ] No duplicate functionality remains
- [ ] Codebase is at least 30% smaller
- [ ] All consolidated systems work correctly
- [ ] TypeScript compilation successful

## 🏗️ Phase 2: Architecture Refactoring (1-2 weeks)

**Status**: ⚪ NOT STARTED  
**Goal**: Reorganize code structure for better maintainability

### Task List:

#### 1. Implement Feature-Based Architecture
- [ ] Create new directory structure:
  ```
  src/features/
    dashboard/
      components/
      hooks/
      utils/
    reviews/
      components/
      hooks/
      utils/
    recommendations/
      components/
      hooks/
      services/
    analytics/
      components/
      hooks/
      utils/
  ```

- [ ] Migrate components to feature folders:
  - [ ] Dashboard feature files
  - [ ] Reviews feature files
  - [ ] Recommendations feature files
  - [ ] Analytics feature files

- [ ] Update all imports to new paths

#### 2. Simplify Hook Architecture
- [ ] Split `useDashboardData` into smaller, focused hooks:
  - [ ] `useReviews` - only fetches reviews
  - [ ] `useBusinessStats` - calculates statistics
  - [ ] `useFilteredData` - handles filtering logic
- [ ] Remove circular dependency risks
- [ ] Ensure single responsibility principle

#### 3. Standardize Service Layer
- [ ] Convert all services to functional approach
- [ ] Remove singleton patterns
- [ ] Create consistent API:
  ```typescript
  // All services should follow this pattern
  export const serviceNameAction = async (params) => { ... }
  ```
- [ ] Remove class-based services

#### 4. Component Optimization
- [ ] Remove unnecessary wrapper components
- [ ] Simplify over-engineered components
- [ ] Implement proper code splitting
- [ ] Remove excessive lazy loading

### Verification Checklist:
- [ ] Clear feature-based organization
- [ ] No circular dependencies
- [ ] Consistent patterns throughout
- [ ] Improved developer experience
