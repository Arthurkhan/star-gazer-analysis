# 2025-06-28: Fix Response Rate Calculation

## Summary

This update fixes a critical bug where the response rate in the monthly reports was always showing 0%. The issue was caused by an incorrect property being used in the calculation.

## Changes

- Fixed the response rate calculation in `src/components/monthly-report/EnhancedSummaryCards.tsx` to use the correct `reviewFieldAccessor`.
- Added the `tooltipStyle` variable back to `src/components/monthly-report/EnhancedSummaryCards.tsx` to resolve a console error that was preventing the monthly report tab from opening.
- Removed unused imports and variables from `src/components/monthly-report/EnhancedSummaryCards.tsx` to improve code quality.

## Impact

The response rate in the monthly reports will now be calculated correctly, providing accurate data to users. The monthly report tab is now accessible and no longer blocked by the console error.
