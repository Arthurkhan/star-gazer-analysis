## 📝 **Key Decisions Made**

1. **Project Structure**: Created dedicated folder for tracking across sessions
2. **Implementation Order**: Decided to start with removals before restructuring
3. **Scope**: Confirmed Review Pattern removal only from Overview tab, not globally
4. **Quality**: Emphasis on testing each phase before moving to next
5. **NEW**: Customer Loyalty removal is low-risk due to placeholder implementation
6. **NEW**: Review Pattern removal from Overview is NO-OP (nothing to remove)
7. **NEW**: Customer Loyalty removal complete with minimal impact - only placeholder code removed
