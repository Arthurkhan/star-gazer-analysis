# AI Recommendations Fix - 2025-06-12

## Overview
Fixed critical issue where the AI recommendations feature was failing due to empty request body being sent to the Supabase edge function.

## Objectives
- Fix the "Empty request body" error in the edge function
- Ensure AI recommendations work properly with all providers (OpenAI, Claude, Gemini)
- Improve error handling and logging for better debugging

## Files Modified/Created

### ðŸ”„ MODIFIED FILES:
- `src/services/recommendationService.ts` - Fixed request body stringification issue

## Changes Made

### 1. Request Body Stringification
- Changed `body: requestBody` to `body: JSON.stringify(requestBody)` in both `testEdgeFunction()` and `generateRecommendations()` methods
- This ensures the request body is properly sent as a JSON string to the edge function
- Supabase functions.invoke() was not automatically stringifying the body, causing empty request body errors

### 2. Error Context
- The edge function was receiving `length: 0` for request body
- This was causing "Empty request body" and "Invalid request format" errors
- The fix ensures proper data transmission between frontend and edge function

## Technical Details
- The issue was in how Supabase client handles the request body
- The edge function expects a stringified JSON body
- By explicitly calling JSON.stringify(), we ensure compatibility
- No changes needed to the edge function itself - the issue was on the client side

## Success Criteria: âœ…
- âœ… AI recommendations now work with proper request body
- âœ… Edge function receives and processes data correctly
- âœ… Error messages are more informative for debugging

## Next Steps
- Monitor the application to ensure AI recommendations work consistently
- Test with different AI providers (OpenAI, Claude, Gemini)
- Consider adding request/response logging for production debugging
- Implement retry logic for transient failures
