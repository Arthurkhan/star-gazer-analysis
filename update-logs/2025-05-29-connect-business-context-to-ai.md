# Connect Business Context to AI Recommendations - 2025-05-29

## Overview
Connected the Business Details (BusinessContext) to the AI Recommendation feature to provide more personalized and context-aware recommendations based on comprehensive business information.

## Objectives
- Include BusinessContext in the recommendation generation flow
- Update the AI prompts to utilize the rich business context
- Enhance recommendation quality with location, operational, and strategic context
- Maintain backward compatibility for businesses without detailed context

## Files Modified/Created

### ðŸ”„ MODIFIED FILES:
- `src/services/recommendationService.ts` - Added BusinessContext to BusinessData interface
- `src/hooks/useRecommendations.ts` - Updated to fetch and include BusinessContext when generating recommendations
- `supabase/functions/generate-recommendations/index.ts` - Enhanced edge function to utilize BusinessContext in AI prompts

## Changes Made

### 1. RecommendationService Enhancement
- Added optional `businessContext?: BusinessContext` field to BusinessData interface
- Added logging to track when business context is included in analysis
- Maintained all existing error handling and timeout functionality

### 2. UseRecommendations Hook Update
- Import `getBusinessContext` from businessContext utils
- Fetch business context for selected business before generating recommendations
- Include business context in the prepared business data sent to the service
- Updated progress messages to reflect context-aware analysis
- Added console logging to track context availability

### 3. Edge Function AI Enhancement
- Parse and format BusinessContext into a structured prompt section
- Build comprehensive contextual information including:
  - Location details (country, city, neighborhood)
  - Operating details (days, hours, capacity, pricing)
  - Business characteristics (specialties, customer types)
  - Market position (competitors, unique selling points)
  - Online presence and delivery platforms
  - Current challenges and business goals
  - Additional free-form context
- Enhanced system prompt to consider all context factors
- Increased max_tokens to 1500 for more detailed recommendations
- Made AI generate recommendations specific to the business's unique situation

- AI now considers location-specific factors (e.g., Thai businesses get Thailand-relevant recommendations)
- Recommendations align with stated business goals and address specific challenges
- Competitive insights are based on actual named competitors
- Marketing suggestions consider existing online presence
- Operational recommendations respect current capacity and hours

## Technical Details
- Backward compatible - works without BusinessContext (falls back to basic analysis)
- No breaking changes to existing interfaces
- Context is passed through the entire recommendation pipeline
- Enhanced AI prompt engineering for better context utilization
- Efficient data structure prevents bloat in API calls

## Success Criteria: âœ…
- âœ… BusinessContext integrated into recommendation service
- âœ… Hook fetches and includes context automatically
- âœ… Edge function utilizes all context fields in AI prompts
- âœ… Backward compatibility maintained
- âœ… No breaking changes to existing functionality

## Next Steps
- Deploy the updated edge function: `supabase functions deploy generate-recommendations`
- Test recommendations with and without business context
- Monitor recommendation quality improvements
- Consider adding context completeness indicators
- Add ability to preview what context will be sent to AI
- Consider caching recommendations with context hash to avoid regenerating
