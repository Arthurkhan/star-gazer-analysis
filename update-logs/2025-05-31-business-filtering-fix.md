# Fix Business Review Filtering Issue - 2025-05-31

## Overview
Fixed an issue where selecting "The Little Prince Cafe" was showing all reviews from all businesses instead of only reviews for that specific business. The issue was caused by inconsistent business ID/name handling in the BusinessSelector component.

## Objectives
- Fix review filtering for "The Little Prince Cafe"
- Ensure proper business name matching in the filtering logic
- Improve debug logging for troubleshooting business selection issues
- Maintain backwards compatibility with legacy data structures

## Files Modified/Created

### üîÑ MODIFIED FILES:
- `src/hooks/useDashboardData.ts` - Enhanced filtering logic with additional fallback checks and debug logging
- `src/components/BusinessSelector.tsx` - Fixed to use business name as ID instead of arbitrary keys

### üÜï NEW FILES:
- None

### üóëÔ∏è DELETED FILES:
- None

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced Review Filtering Logic (`useDashboardData.ts`)
- Added comprehensive filtering checks to handle multiple data formats:
  - Check `review.title` field (legacy data)
  - Check `review.businesses?.name` field (normalized data)
  - Check `review.businessName` field (additional legacy compatibility)
- Added debug logging specifically for "The Little Prince Cafe" to help identify filtering issues
- Improved comments and documentation for the filtering logic

### 2. Fixed BusinessSelector Component
- Changed business option generation to use business name as the ID instead of array index
- Added debug logging for business options and selection changes
- Ensured consistent ID/name handling throughout the component
- Added fallback to use the key as name if the name property is not set

## Technical Details
- The root cause was that the BusinessSelector was using the key from `Object.entries()` as the ID, which could be inconsistent
- The filtering logic was expecting the business name but was receiving an arbitrary ID
- Solution ensures that the business name is always used as the identifier for consistency
- Added comprehensive fallback checks to handle various data structures from both legacy and normalized databases

## Success Criteria: ‚úÖ
- ‚úÖ "The Little Prince Cafe" now shows only its own reviews
- ‚úÖ Other businesses continue to show correct review counts
- ‚úÖ "All Businesses" view continues to show all reviews
- ‚úÖ Backwards compatibility maintained with legacy data structures

## Next Steps
- Monitor the application to ensure the fix is working properly
- Consider adding unit tests for the filtering logic
- May need to investigate if there are similar issues with other parts of the application that rely on business selection
