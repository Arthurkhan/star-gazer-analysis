# Multi-Provider AI Support and Local AI Removal - 2025-06-11

## Overview
Removed Local AI functionality completely and added support for multiple AI providers (OpenAI, Claude, Gemini) with model selection for each provider.

## Objectives
- Remove all references to Local AI / Browser AI
- Add model selection dropdowns for OpenAI, Claude, and Gemini
- Update edge function to support all three AI providers
- Enable users to switch between providers and models dynamically
- Ensure proper API key management for each provider

## Files Modified/Created

### üÜï NEW FILES:
- `update-logs/2025-06-11-multi-provider-ai-support.md` - This update log

### üîÑ MODIFIED FILES:
- `src/pages/AISettings.tsx` - Added model selection for each provider
- `src/services/recommendationService.ts` - Updated to support multiple providers and models
- `supabase/functions/generate-recommendations/index.ts` - Complete rewrite to support all providers

### üóëÔ∏è DELETED FILES:
None - Local AI files were already removed (empty placeholders)

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced AI Settings Page
- Added model selection dropdown for each provider:
  - **OpenAI**: GPT-4o, GPT-4o Mini, GPT-4 Turbo, GPT-4, GPT-3.5 Turbo
  - **Claude**: Claude 3 Opus, Claude 3 Sonnet, Claude 3 Haiku
  - **Gemini**: Gemini 1.5 Pro, Gemini 1.5 Flash, Gemini Pro
- Models are saved to localStorage alongside API keys
- Test connection now includes the selected model in the response

### 2. Updated Recommendation Service
- Modified to read provider, API key, and model from localStorage
- Passes provider, model, and API key to edge function
- Improved error messages for different API failure scenarios
- Enhanced logging to show which provider and model are being used

### 3. Complete Edge Function Rewrite
- Supports all three AI providers (OpenAI, Claude, Gemini)
- Unified prompt structure for consistent results across providers
- Provider-specific API implementations:
  - OpenAI: Uses chat completions API with JSON mode
  - Claude: Uses messages API with JSON extraction
  - Gemini: Uses generateContent API with JSON response type
- Better error handling with specific messages for 401/429 errors
- Metadata now includes provider and model information

## Technical Details
- All providers use the same prompt structure for consistency
- JSON response format enforced for all providers
- API keys and models stored separately in localStorage
- No breaking changes for existing users
- Fallback recommendations still available on API errors

## Success Criteria: ‚úÖ
- ‚úÖ Local AI completely removed
- ‚úÖ Model selection added for all providers
- ‚úÖ Edge function supports OpenAI, Claude, and Gemini
- ‚úÖ Proper error handling for each provider
- ‚úÖ API keys and models properly managed
- ‚úÖ Consistent recommendation format across providers

## Next Steps
- Deploy the updated edge function: `supabase functions deploy generate-recommendations`
- Test each provider with different models
- Monitor API usage and costs for each provider
- Consider adding provider-specific features (e.g., Claude's larger context window)
- Add cost estimates for each model in the UI
