### üîÑ MODIFIED FILES:
- `src/services/recommendationService.ts` - Fixed the transformRecommendations method to preserve edge function response structure

### üóëÔ∏è DELETED FILES:
- None

## Changes Made

### 1. Recommendation Service Transformation Fix
- Modified the `transformRecommendations` method to preserve the original edge function response structure
- Added direct property mapping for:
  - `urgentActions` (already working)
  - `growthStrategies` (already working)
  - `customerAttractionPlan` (was missing - now fixed)
  - `competitivePositioning` (was missing - now fixed)
  - `futureProjections` (was missing - now fixed)
- Maintained all existing transformations for backward compatibility

### 2. Export Function Enhancement
- Updated the `exportRecommendations` method to include Future Projections section
- Added both short-term and long-term projections to the export text

## Technical Details
- **Root Cause**: The transformation method was restructuring the edge function response but not preserving the original properties that the UI component expected
- **Solution**: Directly pass through the edge function response properties while keeping transformations for backward compatibility
- **No Breaking Changes**: All existing functionality remains intact

## Success Criteria: ‚úÖ
- ‚úÖ Marketing tab now displays customer attraction strategies
- ‚úÖ Position tab now displays competitive positioning analysis
- ‚úÖ Future tab now displays short and long-term projections
- ‚úÖ Backward compatibility maintained for all existing components
- ‚úÖ Export functionality includes all recommendation sections

## Next Steps
- Test with all three businesses to ensure recommendations display correctly
- Monitor for any edge cases where recommendations might not display
- Consider adding unit tests for the transformation logic
