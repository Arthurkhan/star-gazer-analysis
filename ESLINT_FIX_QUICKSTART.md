# Quick Start: Fixing ESLint Issues

## ðŸš€ Immediate Steps

### 1. Commit Your Current Work
Since tests are now passing and lint-staged allows up to 50 warnings:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Your commit message"
git push
```

### 2. Run Targeted Fix (Recommended First)
This removes the most common unused imports and fixes duplicates:
```bash
npm run lint:fix-targeted
```

### 3. Check Progress
```bash
npm run lint
```

### 4. Run Comprehensive Fix
For deeper fixes including unused variable detection:
```bash
npm run lint:fix-comprehensive
```

## ðŸ“Š Available Fix Scripts

| Script | Purpose | Use When |
|--------|---------|----------|
| `npm run lint:fix` | Basic ESLint auto-fix | Quick formatting fixes |
| `npm run lint:fix-critical` | Quick critical fixes | Need fast reduction in errors |
| `npm run lint:fix-targeted` | Remove common unused imports | **Start here - biggest impact** |
| `npm run lint:fix-comprehensive` | Advanced import analysis | After targeted fix |

## ðŸŽ¯ Manual Fixes Needed

After running auto-fix scripts, you'll need to manually fix:

1. **Type Safety** - Replace `any` with proper types
2. **React Hook Dependencies** - Add missing deps or disable rule
3. **Actual Unused Variables** - Remove or use them
4. **Control Flow** - Replace `alert()` with proper UI

## ðŸ’¡ Pro Tips

- Run `npm install` first to ensure glob is installed
- Scripts are safe to run multiple times
- Focus on errors first, then warnings
- Commit frequently as you fix issues

## ðŸ”„ Current Status

- âœ… Tests are passing
- âœ… Commits allowed with up to 50 warnings
- ðŸ”§ 961 ESLint issues to fix (but most are auto-fixable!)
