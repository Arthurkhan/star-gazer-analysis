# Unique Reviewer Constraint - 2025-05-31

## Overview
Added unique constraints to ensure each person can only leave one review per business. This prevents duplicate reviews from the same person for a single business while still allowing them to review multiple businesses.

## Objectives
- Prevent duplicate reviews from the same person for each business
- Maintain data integrity by enforcing one review per person per business
- Clean up existing duplicate reviews before applying constraints

## Files Modified/Created

### 🔄 MODIFIED FILES:
- Database schema modifications via Supabase migrations (no application files were changed)

### 🗑️ DELETED FILES:
- None

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Migration
- Applied migration `remove_duplicates_and_add_unique_constraint` to the Supabase database
- Removed 1 duplicate review (older review from Shanisa Churat in The Little Prince Cafe)
- Dropped existing composite primary key constraints on (name, reviewUrl)
- Added UNIQUE constraints on the "name" column for each business table:
  - `the_little_prince_cafe_name_unique` on "The Little Prince Cafe" table
  - `vol_de_nuit_name_unique` on "Vol de Nuit, The Hidden Bar" table
  - `lenvol_art_space_name_unique` on "L'Envol Art Space" table

### 2. Data Cleanup
- Identified and removed duplicate reviews, keeping only the most recent review per person
- Only one duplicate found: Shanisa Churat had 2 reviews for The Little Prince Cafe
- Kept the March 2025 review and removed the July 2024 review

## Technical Details
- Migration ensures referential integrity at the database level
- Any attempt to insert a duplicate name for the same business will now fail with a unique constraint violation
- No changes to application code required - constraint is enforced at database level
- Performance impact: minimal, as unique constraints create indexes that can actually improve query performance

## Success Criteria: ✅
- ✅ Unique constraints added to all three business tables
- ✅ Existing duplicate reviews removed
- ✅ Verification shows equal number of total reviews and unique reviewers per business
- ✅ Database prevents future duplicate reviews per business

## Next Steps
- Monitor n8n workflow to ensure it handles constraint violations gracefully
- Consider adding application-level handling for duplicate review attempts
- Update any data import scripts to check for duplicates before insertion
