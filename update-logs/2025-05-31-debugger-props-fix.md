# Period Comparison Debugger Props Fix - 2025-05-31

## Overview
Fixed the Period Comparison Debugger to properly receive the selected business state from the Dashboard component instead of using its own isolated hook instance.

## Objectives
- Fix the debugger not recognizing the selected business
- Share state between Dashboard and PeriodComparisonDebugger
- Enable proper testing of the period comparison feature

## Files Modified/Created

### ðŸ”„ MODIFIED FILES:
- `src/components/debug/PeriodComparisonDebugger.tsx` - Changed from using its own useDashboardData hook to accepting props
- `src/pages/Dashboard.tsx` - Updated to pass required props to PeriodComparisonDebugger

## Changes Made

### 1. PeriodComparisonDebugger Component
- Added TypeScript interface for props:
  ```typescript
  interface PeriodComparisonDebuggerProps {
    selectedBusiness: string;
    loading: boolean;
    refreshData: (from?: Date, to?: Date) => Promise<void>;
    getFilteredReviews: () => any[];
  }
  ```
- Removed `useDashboardData` hook usage
- Now receives all necessary data through props
- Added display of current business selection
- Improved date range display in debug output

### 2. Dashboard Component
- Updated to pass props to PeriodComparisonDebugger:
  ```tsx
  <PeriodComparisonDebugger 
    selectedBusiness={selectedBusiness}
    loading={loading}
    refreshData={refreshData}
    getFilteredReviews={getFilteredReviews}
  />
  ```

## Technical Details
- The issue was that hooks create separate instances of state
- Each component using `useDashboardData()` gets its own isolated state
- By passing props, we ensure the debugger uses the same state as the Dashboard
- This is a common React pattern - lift state up and pass down as props

## Success Criteria: âœ…
- âœ… Debugger now recognizes the selected business
- âœ… Button is enabled when a specific business is selected
- âœ… Debug tests can run with proper business context
- âœ… State is properly shared between components

## Next Steps
1. Run the debug test with a business selected
2. Check the output for date filtering results
3. If issues are found, they're likely data-related rather than code-related
4. Remove the debug tab once the period comparison is verified working
