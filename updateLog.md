## 2025-05-21: Performance Optimization and Code Cleanup

### Analysis Summary
- Identified database schema transition from one-table-per-business to normalized schema
- Found inefficient data loading patterns causing UI slowdowns
- Detected lack of proper pagination in frontend components
- Identified client-side AI processing blocking the main thread
- Found inconsistent use of caching strategies

   - Implemented skeleton loading states for better user experience

3. **AI Processing Optimization**
   - Moved browser-based AI processing to Web Workers to prevent main thread blocking
   - Added `aiProcessing.worker.ts` to handle intensive computations off the main thread
   - Created new `browserAIService` with proper worker communication and fallback mechanisms
