## Overview
Prepared the Star-Gazer-Analysis project for deployment on Netlify and embedding in Squarespace

## Objectives
- Configure project for Netlify deployment
- Enable iframe embedding for Squarespace integration
- Secure environment variables and sensitive data
- Set up proper build configuration

## Files Modified/Created

### 🆕 NEW FILES:
- `netlify.toml` - Netlify configuration for build settings and headers
- `.env.example` - Example environment variables file for reference

### 🔄 MODIFIED FILES:
- `.gitignore` - Added environment files and Netlify folders to ignore list

### 🗑️ DELETED FILES:
- None

## Changes Made

### 1. Netlify Configuration
- Created `netlify.toml` with proper build commands and publish directory
- Set Node.js version to 18 for compatibility
- Configured headers to allow iframe embedding (X-Frame-Options: ALLOWALL)

- Headers configured for iframe compatibility
- SPA routing properly configured

## Success Criteria: ✅
- ✅ Netlify configuration file created
