# Fix Detailed Analysis Auto-Update - 2025-05-30

## Overview
Fixed an issue where the Detailed Analysis section in the "All Reviews" tab doesn't automatically update when changing the business. Previously, users had to manually click the refresh button to update the data.

## Objectives
- Enable automatic update of Detailed Analysis when business selection changes
- Maintain the refresh button functionality for manual updates
- Ensure proper data flow through component hierarchy

## Files Modified/Created

### üîÑ MODIFIED FILES:
- `src/pages/Dashboard.tsx` - Added selectedBusiness prop to DashboardContent component
- `src/components/dashboard/DashboardContent.tsx` - Added selectedBusiness prop and passed it to AllReviewsContent
- `src/components/dashboard/AllReviewsContent.tsx` - Added selectedBusiness prop and passed the actual business name to AnalysisSummary

### üÜï NEW FILES:

## Changes Made

### 1. Dashboard Component
- Modified the DashboardContent usage to include selectedBusiness prop
- Ensures the selected business is passed down through the component tree

### 2. DashboardContent Component
- Added selectedBusiness to the component props interface
- Set default value to "all" if not provided
- Passed the prop down to AllReviewsContent component

### 3. AllReviewsContent Component
- Added selectedBusiness to the component props interface
- Created logic to determine the display business name (handles "all" vs specific business)
- Replaced hardcoded "Current Business" with the actual selected business name in AnalysisSummary

## Technical Details
- The issue was caused by AnalysisSummary receiving a hardcoded businessName prop value of "Current Business"
- The fix ensures proper prop drilling from Dashboard ‚Üí DashboardContent ‚Üí AllReviewsContent ‚Üí AnalysisSummary
- The AnalysisSummary component already has memoization logic that triggers re-calculation when businessName changes
- No performance impact as existing memoization is maintained

## Success Criteria: ‚úÖ
- ‚úÖ Detailed Analysis updates automatically when changing business
- ‚úÖ Refresh button remains functional
- ‚úÖ No regression in existing functionality

## Next Steps
- Monitor for any edge cases with business name handling
- Consider implementing a context provider for business selection to avoid prop drilling in the future
- Test with all business types to ensure consistent behavior
