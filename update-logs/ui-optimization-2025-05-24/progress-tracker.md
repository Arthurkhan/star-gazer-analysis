## 🚧 **Issues & Blockers**

### Current Issues
*None identified*

### Resolved Issues
*None - Phase 2 completed without any blockers*

## 📝 **Key Decisions Made**

1. **Project Structure**: Created dedicated folder for tracking across sessions
2. **Implementation Order**: Decided to start with removals before restructuring
3. **Scope**: Confirmed Review Pattern removal only from Overview tab, not globally
4. **Quality**: Emphasis on testing each phase before moving to next
5. **Customer Loyalty removal**: Low-risk due to placeholder implementation
6. **Review Pattern removal**: NO-OP (nothing to remove from Overview)
7. **Phase 1 approach**: Minimal, surgical changes to maintain stability
8. **Phase 2 component order**: Overview → Analysis → Raw Data for better UX
9. **Phase 2 sections**: Added descriptive headers for improved navigation
10. **Phase 2 performance**: Prioritized basic stats loading before complex analysis
