# Overview Tab Layout Fix - 2025-05-24

## Overview
Fixed the layout for the "Detailed Analysis" section within the Overview tab's "All Reviews" sub-tab to display all analysis cards (Executive Summary, Performance Metrics, etc.) vertically instead of side-by-side.

## Objectives
- âœ… Display all analysis cards vertically in the Overview > All Reviews > Detailed Analysis section
- âœ… Remove side-by-side grid layout for analysis cards
- âœ… Ensure all cards take full width and stack one under another
- âœ… Maintain responsive design and existing functionality

## Files Modified/Created

### ðŸ”„ MODIFIED FILES:
- `src/components/analysis/AnalysisSummary.tsx` - Updated default layout to use single column grid
- `src/pages/Dashboard.tsx` - Reverted tab name back to "Enhanced Analysis"

## Changes Made

### 1. AnalysisSummary Component Layout Fix
- Changed `DEFAULT_VIEW_CONFIG.columns` from `2` to `1` to force vertical layout
- Updated `getLayoutStyles` function to always use `'grid-cols-1'` instead of responsive grid columns
- Removed multi-column grid options that were causing side-by-side display
- Analysis cards now stack vertically: Executive Summary, Performance Metrics, Sentiment Analysis, etc.

### 2. Dashboard Component Revert
- Reverted tab name from "All Reviews" back to "Enhanced Analysis"
- Removed the fullView prop that was mistakenly applied

## Technical Details
- **Layout Change**: Forced single column grid layout (`grid-cols-1`) for vertical stacking
- **Cards Affected**: Executive Summary, Performance Metrics, Sentiment Analysis, Thematic Analysis, Staff Insights, Operational Insights, Action Items
- **Responsive Design**: Maintained full width design across all screen sizes
- **Performance**: No impact on existing performance monitoring and optimizations

## Success Criteria: âœ…
- âœ… Analysis cards display vertically in Overview tab's Detailed Analysis section
- âœ… Each card takes full width of the container
- âœ… No side-by-side layout on any screen size
- âœ… All existing functionality preserved (tabs, fullscreen, etc.)
- âœ… "Enhanced Analysis" tab name restored correctly

## Next Steps
- Test the new vertical layout across different screen sizes
- Verify all analysis cards load and display correctly
- Monitor user feedback on the improved layout
- Consider adding visual separators between cards if needed
