# AI Recommendations JSON Parsing Fix - 2025-06-11

## Overview
Fixed the "Unexpected end of JSON input" error that was preventing AI recommendations from being properly generated and displayed.

## Objectives
- Fix JSON parsing error in the edge function
- Ensure OpenAI returns properly formatted JSON responses
- Improve error handling and logging for better debugging

## Files Modified/Created

### ðŸ”„ MODIFIED FILES:
- `supabase/functions/generate-recommendations/index.ts` - Fixed JSON parsing and improved OpenAI integration

## Changes Made

### 1. Edge Function Improvements
- Added `response_format: { type: "json_object" }` to OpenAI API call to force JSON responses
- Improved JSON parsing logic with better error handling
- Enhanced logging to show response content for debugging
- Clearer system prompt that emphasizes returning only valid JSON
- Better validation of response structure before parsing

### 2. Error Handling Enhancements
- More descriptive error messages
- Better handling of edge cases in JSON parsing
- Improved fallback mechanism when API fails

## Technical Details
- The issue was caused by OpenAI sometimes returning responses with explanatory text before or after the JSON, causing parsing to fail
- Using the `response_format` parameter ensures OpenAI returns only valid JSON
- Added trimming and JSON extraction logic as a fallback for edge cases
- Improved logging helps diagnose issues in production

## Success Criteria: âœ…
- âœ… AI recommendations now generate successfully without JSON parsing errors
- âœ… Proper error messages are shown when API key is invalid or rate limited
- âœ… Fallback recommendations work when OpenAI is unavailable
- âœ… Better logging for debugging production issues

## Next Steps
- Deploy the updated edge function using: `supabase functions deploy generate-recommendations`
- Monitor the logs to ensure the fix is working in production
- Consider implementing retry logic for transient failures
- Add caching to reduce API calls for similar requests
