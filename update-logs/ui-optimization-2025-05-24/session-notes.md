# Session Notes - UI Optimization Project

## üóìÔ∏è **Session History**

### Session 1: May 24, 2025 (Initial Planning)
**Duration:** ~2 hours  
**Participants:** User + AI Assistant  
**Status:** ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**

#### What Was Accomplished:
1. **Codebase Analysis**
   - Analyzed current application structure
   - Identified key components and their relationships
   - Located main dashboard, overview sections, and monthly reports
   - Examined AI Settings page structure

2. **Requirements Clarification**
   - Confirmed removal of Customer Loyalty feature (complete removal)
   - Confirmed removal of Review Pattern from Overview tab only (not global)
   - Clarified Overview tab layout requirements (charts on top, full-width sections)
   - Defined Monthly report enhancement needs
   - Specified AI Settings back button requirement

3. **Project Structure Setup**
   - Created dedicated project tracking folder
   - Established roadmap with 5 distinct phases
   - Set up progress tracking system
   - Created comprehensive documentation

4. **Technical Planning**
   - Identified specific files that need modification
   - Created detailed task breakdown for each phase
   - Established success criteria and testing requirements
   - Planned implementation timeline

#### Key Findings:
- Customer Loyalty feature appears to be integrated into analysis components
- Review Pattern exists in multiple contexts, need careful removal from Overview only
- Overview layout is currently in `AllReviewsContent.tsx` and related components
- Monthly report has basic structure but needs significant enhancement
- AI Settings page (`AISettings.tsx`) needs simple back button addition

#### Decisions Made:
1. **Implementation Order**: Remove features first, then restructure layout
2. **Scope Control**: Review Pattern removal only from Overview tab
3. **Quality Focus**: Test each phase before proceeding
4. **Documentation**: Maintain detailed progress tracking for session continuity

#### Files Identified for Modification:
- `src/components/dashboard/AllReviewsContent.tsx` (Phase 2)
- `src/components/OverviewSection.tsx` (Phase 2) 
- `src/components/analysis/AnalysisSummary.tsx` (Phase 1 & 2)
- `src/components/monthly-report/MonthlyReport.tsx` (Phase 3)
- `src/pages/AISettings.tsx` (Phase 4)
- Various component files containing Customer Loyalty (Phase 1 - TBD)
