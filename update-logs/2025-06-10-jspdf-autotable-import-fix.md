# jsPDF-AutoTable Import Error Fix - 2025-06-10

## Overview
Fixed browser console error related to jspdf-autotable module imports that was preventing the app from running properly.

## Objectives
- Fix import syntax for jspdf-autotable in all files
- Ensure PDF export functionality works correctly
- Prevent "does not provide an export named 'default'" error

## Files Modified/Created

### ðŸ”„ MODIFIED FILES:
- `src/utils/periodComparisonExport.ts` - Changed import from default to side-effect only
- `src/utils/pdfExport.ts` - Fixed import statement for jspdf-autotable
- `src/services/exportService.ts` - Updated import and usage of autoTable

## Changes Made

### 1. Import Statement Fix
- Changed from: `import autoTable from 'jspdf-autotable';`
- Changed to: `import 'jspdf-autotable';`
- Reason: jspdf-autotable doesn't export a default export; it extends the jsPDF prototype

### 2. Usage Pattern Update
- Changed from: `autoTable(doc, {...})`
- Changed to: `(doc as any).autoTable({...})`
- This reflects how jspdf-autotable actually works - it adds the autoTable method to jsPDF instances

### 3. Files Updated
- **periodComparisonExport.ts**: Fixed all occurrences of autoTable usage
- **pdfExport.ts**: Updated import statement
- **exportService.ts**: Fixed import and all autoTable function calls

## Technical Details
- jspdf-autotable works by extending the jsPDF prototype
- It doesn't have a default export, only side effects
- The module adds the `autoTable` method directly to jsPDF instances
- TypeScript requires casting to `any` since the types don't reflect the prototype extension

## Success Criteria: âœ…
- âœ… Console error resolved
- âœ… App runs without import errors
- âœ… PDF export functionality maintained
- âœ… All three files using jspdf-autotable updated

## Next Steps
- Test PDF export features to ensure they work correctly
- Consider adding proper TypeScript declarations for jspdf-autotable
- Monitor for any other module import issues
