# Timezone Analysis Report - 2025-06-18

## Overview
Analysis of how the Star-Gazer-Analysis application handles timezone differences between stored data (UTC+0) and actual review creation time (UTC+7).

## Current Situation

### Database Storage
- All review dates in Supabase are stored in UTC+0 timezone
- Reviews were actually created in UTC+7 timezone (Bangkok, Thailand)
- This creates a 7-hour difference between stored time and actual local time

### Code Analysis

#### 1. **Date Storage & Retrieval**
- `src/services/reviewDataService.ts`: Fetches dates directly from database without timezone conversion
- Dates are stored and retrieved as ISO strings in UTC format

#### 2. **Date Processing**
- `src/utils/reviewDataUtils.ts`: 
  - Uses `new Date(dateString)` to parse dates
  - Extracts day of week using `date.toLocaleString('en-US', { weekday: 'long' })`
  - Extracts hour using `date.getHours()`
  - **ISSUE**: These operations use the user's browser timezone, NOT the original review timezone

#### 3. **Date Display**
- `src/components/ReviewsTable.tsx`:
  - Uses `formatDistanceToNow()` for relative time display
  - Uses `toLocaleDateString()` for full date display
  - **ISSUE**: Both use browser's local timezone for display

#### 4. **Period Comparison**
- `src/hooks/usePeriodComparison.ts`:
  - Converts dates to ISO strings for database queries
  - Filters use UTC timestamps for comparison
  - **PARTIAL ISSUE**: Date range filtering works correctly, but day/hour analysis will be off

## Impact Analysis

### ✅ **What Works Correctly:**
1. **Date Ordering**: Reviews are sorted correctly by date
2. **Period Filtering**: Date range comparisons work properly
3. **Relative Time Display**: "X days ago" calculations are accurate
4. **Month/Year Grouping**: Monthly statistics are correct

### ❌ **What's Affected:**
1. **Time of Day Analysis**: 
   - A review posted at 2 PM Bangkok time (UTC+7) is stored as 7 AM UTC
   - Analysis shows it as morning activity instead of afternoon
   - **7-hour shift** in time-based patterns

2. **Day of Week Analysis**:
   - Reviews posted late evening in Bangkok might show as next day
   - Example: Review at 11 PM Tuesday Bangkok = 4 PM Tuesday UTC = could show as Wednesday in some timezones

3. **Seasonal Analysis**:
   - Minor edge case: Very late December reviews might show in January

4. **Business Hours Insights**:
   - Peak hours analysis is shifted by timezone difference
   - "Busiest times" are off by the timezone delta

## Recommendations

### Option 1: Store Original Timezone (Recommended)
- Add a `timezone` column to store original timezone
- Add a `localDateTime` column to store the local time
- Keep existing UTC time for sorting/filtering

### Option 2: Timezone Conversion in App
- Detect business location timezone (UTC+7 for Bangkok)
- Convert all dates to business timezone before analysis
- Display times in business local time

### Option 3: Document Current Behavior
- Add timezone notice in the UI
- Explain that times are shown in browser timezone
- Note that patterns may be shifted from actual local time

## Implementation Priority
- **High Priority**: Time of day analysis fix (most affected)
- **Medium Priority**: Day of week analysis adjustment
- **Low Priority**: Display timezone indicators

## Next Steps
1. Decide on approach (recommend Option 2 for immediate fix)
2. Implement timezone conversion utilities
3. Update analysis functions to use business timezone
4. Add timezone indicators in UI
5. Test with various browser timezones
