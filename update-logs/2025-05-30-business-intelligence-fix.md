# Business Intelligence Insights Fix - 2025-05-30

## Overview
Fixed an issue where the Business Intelligence & Recommendations section in the Monthly Report tab was always showing "Cafe Insights" regardless of which business was selected (Bar or Gallery).

## Objectives
- Ensure Business Intelligence shows correct insights for each business type
- Pass business information properly through component hierarchy
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing functionality

## Files Modified/Created

### ðŸ”„ MODIFIED FILES:
- `src/components/dashboard/DashboardContent.tsx` - Added business type detection and prop passing

## Changes Made

### 1. DashboardContent Component
- Added import for `getBusinessTypeFromName` utility function
- Added business type calculation logic based on selected business
- Updated MonthlyReport component call to pass:
  - `businessName` prop (handles "all" businesses case)
  - `businessType` prop with correct type ("CAFE", "BAR", or "GALLERY")
- Default to "CAFE" type when viewing all businesses together

## Technical Details
- The issue was that MonthlyReport component had a default businessType of "CAFE" and wasn't receiving the actual business type
- Solution uses existing business mapping utilities to determine correct type
- No breaking changes - maintains backward compatibility
- Performance impact: Minimal (single function call for type detection)

## Success Criteria: âœ…
- âœ… Business Intelligence shows "Cafe Insights" for The Little Prince Cafe
- âœ… Business Intelligence shows "Bar Insights" for Vol de Nuit The Hidden Bar  
- âœ… Business Intelligence shows "Gallery Insights" for L'Envol Art Space
- âœ… No breaking changes to existing functionality
- âœ… Clean implementation using existing utilities

## Next Steps
- Monitor for any edge cases with new businesses added in the future
- Consider adding tests for business type detection in Monthly Report
- No immediate follow-up required - fix is complete and self-contained
