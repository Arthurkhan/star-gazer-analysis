# Remove Local AI Feature - 2025-06-11

## Overview
Complete removal of Local AI/Browser AI feature from the application, keeping only cloud-based AI providers (OpenAI, Claude, Gemini).

## Objectives
- Remove all Local AI/Browser AI related files
- Clean up any references to local AI in the codebase
- Ensure the application only uses cloud-based AI providers
- Simplify the AI service architecture

## Files Modified/Created

### üÜï NEW FILES:
- `update-logs/2025-06-11-remove-local-ai.md` - This update log

### üîÑ MODIFIED FILES:
None - All Local AI files were empty placeholders

### üóëÔ∏è DELETED FILES:
- `src/services/ai/BrowserAIService.ts` - Empty placeholder file
- `src/services/ai/ai-worker.js` - Empty placeholder file
- `src/services/ai/aiWorker.ts` - Empty placeholder file
- `src/services/ai/browserAI.ts` - Empty placeholder file
- `src/services/ai/browserAIService.ts` - Empty placeholder file
- `src/services/ai/worker.ts` - Empty placeholder file

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed Browser AI Files
- Deleted all empty Browser AI/Local AI related files from `src/services/ai/` directory
- These files were never implemented and contained no code

### 2. Verified No Active References
- Confirmed no references to local/browser AI in:
  - recommendationService.ts (only uses OpenAI via Supabase)
  - aiServiceFactory.ts (only includes cloud providers)
  - AISettings.tsx (only shows cloud provider options)
  - aiService.ts types (only defines cloud provider types)

## Technical Details
- No functional changes to the application
- Removed technical debt of empty placeholder files
- Simplified the AI service structure
- No breaking changes - Local AI was never functional

## Success Criteria: ‚úÖ
- ‚úÖ All Local AI files removed
- ‚úÖ No references to Local AI in the codebase
- ‚úÖ Application continues to work with cloud AI providers
- ‚úÖ Cleaner project structure

## Next Steps
- Continue using cloud-based AI providers
- No migration needed as Local AI was never implemented
- Consider documenting the decision to use only cloud providers
