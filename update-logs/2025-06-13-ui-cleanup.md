# UI Cleanup - 2025-06-13

## Overview
Removed the Local AI button feature and the average rating line from the performance chart to simplify the user interface.

## Objectives
- Remove Local AI button from the AI provider toggle component
- Remove average rating line from the reviews chart
- Simplify the UI by reducing unnecessary options

## Files Modified/Created

### ðŸ”„ MODIFIED FILES:
- `src/components/AIProviderToggle.tsx` - Removed Local AI button, kept only Advanced AI
- `src/components/ReviewsChart.tsx` - Removed average rating line and related controls

## Changes Made

### 1. AIProviderToggle Component
- Removed the Local AI (browser) button entirely
- Set the default provider to 'api' (Advanced AI)
- Kept the Advanced AI button as the only option (disabled state)
- Removed the Brain icon import as it's no longer needed
- Simplified the component to show only one button

### 2. ReviewsChart Component
- Removed the `showAvgRating` state variable
- Removed the Eye/EyeOff toggle button for showing/hiding average rating
- Removed the second Y-axis configuration for average rating
- Removed the second Line component that displayed average rating
- Updated the card description from "Monthly review count and average rating" to "Monthly review count"
- Removed the formatter function for average rating in the Tooltip
- Simplified the chart to show only review counts

## Technical Details
- No breaking changes for other components
- The AIProvider type still supports both 'browser' and 'api' for backward compatibility
- The chart data structure remains unchanged (still contains avgRating data if needed in the future)
- Performance improvement: Less rendering overhead with fewer chart elements

## Success Criteria: âœ…
- âœ… Local AI button removed from the interface
- âœ… Average rating line removed from the chart
- âœ… UI simplified without breaking functionality

## Next Steps
