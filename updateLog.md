# Update Log for Star-Gazer-Analysis

> **Note**: Historical update logs have been moved to the `/update-logs/` folder for better organization and token efficiency.

## Current Structure

Update logs are now organized in the `/update-logs/` folder:
- Each session or major feature gets its own markdown file
- Files are named with date and descriptive title (e.g., `2025-05-24-session-1.md`)
- This reduces token consumption when creating new updates
- Historical context is preserved but better organized

## Recent Updates

- Moved historical updates to `2025-05-24-historical-updates.md`
