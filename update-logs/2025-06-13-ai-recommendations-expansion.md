# AI Recommendations Expansion - 2025-06-13

## Overview
Updated the AI recommendations system to generate and display 5 recommendations instead of 3 for both urgent actions and growth strategies, providing more comprehensive insights for businesses.

## Objectives
- Increase the number of urgent actions from 3 to 5
- Increase the number of growth strategies from 3 to 5
- Maintain consistency across edge function and frontend service

## Files Modified/Created

### ðŸ”„ MODIFIED FILES:
- `supabase/functions/generate-recommendations/index.ts` - Updated prompt and fallback to return 5 recommendations
- `src/services/recommendationService.ts` - Removed array slicing to display all 5 recommendations

## Changes Made

### 1. Edge Function Update
- Modified `getUnifiedPrompt` function to request 5 urgent actions and 5 growth strategies in the system prompt
- Updated the fallback response to include 5 items for both urgent actions and growth strategies
- Added two new urgent actions in fallback: "Staff Training Enhancement" and "Follow-up System"
- Added two new growth strategies in fallback: "Service Expansion" and "Digital Presence Enhancement"

### 2. Recommendation Service Update
- Removed `.slice(0, 3)` from `patternInsights` mapping to include all growth strategies
- Removed `.slice(0, 3)` from action plan steps to include all urgent actions
- Updated comments to reflect the change from 3 to 5 recommendations

## Technical Details
- No breaking changes - the UI components will automatically handle the additional recommendations
- Performance impact is minimal as the AI models can easily generate 5 recommendations
- The change provides more value to users by offering more comprehensive business insights

## Success Criteria: âœ…
- âœ… Edge function returns 5 urgent actions - completed
- âœ… Edge function returns 5 growth strategies - completed
