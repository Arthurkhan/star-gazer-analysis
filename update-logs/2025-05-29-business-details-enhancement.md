- Organize the information in a more user-friendly tabbed interface
- Prepare the data structure for future AI integration
- Add currency selection with country-based defaults
- Fix input fields to allow proper typing with spaces and commas

## Files Modified/Created

### ðŸ”„ MODIFIED FILES:
- `src/utils/businessContext.ts` - Expanded BusinessContext interface with comprehensive fields and currency utilities
- `src/components/BusinessDetailsDialog.tsx` - Complete redesign with tabbed interface and fixed input handling

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced BusinessContext Interface
Added new fields organized into logical groups:
- **Location Details**: Added neighborhood/district for more granular location context
- **Operating Details**: 
  - Operating days (which days of the week)
  - Peak hours (specific busy times)
  - Average transaction value
  - Seating capacity (for physical locations)
  - Currency selection (NEW)
- **Market Position**:
  - Main competitors (helps with competitive analysis)
  - Unique selling points (what makes the business special)
- **Online Presence**:
  - Website, Instagram, Facebook, Google My Business checkboxes

- **Business Goals & Challenges**:
  - Current challenges/pain points
  - Short-term business goals (3-6 months)
- **Additional Context**: Free-form text field for any other relevant information

### 2. Redesigned BusinessDetailsDialog
- Implemented tabbed interface for better organization:
  - **Location Tab**: Country, city, neighborhood, operating days, peak hours
  - **Operations Tab**: Price range, currency, average transaction, seating capacity, specialties, customer types, online presence
  - **Market Tab**: Competitors and unique selling points
  - **Goals Tab**: Current challenges, business goals, and additional context field
- Added icons to tabs for better visual hierarchy
- Improved form layout with grids and proper spacing
- Added helpful placeholders and descriptions

- Supports manual currency selection override
- Country to currency mapping includes:

  - Regional currencies (THB, SGD, AUD, CAD, etc.)
  - Default to USD if country not recognized

### 4. Input Field Fix (NEW)
- Fixed issue where users couldn't type spaces or commas in comma-separated fields
- Separated display state from data state for better user experience
- Now stores raw input strings and only processes them into arrays on save
- Changed small Input fields to Textarea for multi-value fields
- Ensures smooth typing experience without cursor jumping

### 5. Key Improvements
- More comprehensive data collection for AI analysis
- Better organization with tabs reduces cognitive load
- Flexible fields (arrays for competitors, challenges, etc.)

- Checkboxes for boolean values (online presence, operating days)
- Contextual fields (seating capacity only for cafes/bars)

- Smooth input experience for all text fields

## Technical Details
- Used existing UI components (Tabs, Checkbox, Textarea, Select)
