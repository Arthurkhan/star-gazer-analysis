# Fix AI Recommendations Edge Function - 2025-06-11

## Overview
Fixed the AI recommendations edge function that was failing with 500 errors even with valid OpenAI credentials.

## Objectives
- Fix the edge function to use a stable OpenAI model
- Improve error handling and debugging
- Ensure fallback recommendations work properly
- Add deployment documentation

## Files Modified/Created

### ðŸ†• NEW FILES:
- `DEPLOY_FUNCTIONS.md` - Guide for deploying Supabase edge functions

### ðŸ”„ MODIFIED FILES:
- `supabase/functions/generate-recommendations/index.ts` - Fixed model and improved error handling

## Changes Made

### 1. Edge Function Fixes
- Changed from `gpt-4o-mini` to `gpt-3.5-turbo-1106` (stable model with JSON mode support)
- Added better error handling for network failures
- Added specific error messages for different HTTP status codes
- Improved JSON parsing error handling
- Increased max_tokens to 3000 for more detailed recommendations
- Added better logging throughout the function

### 2. Error Handling Improvements
- Network errors are now caught and reported clearly
- API key validation errors (401) provide clear messages
- Rate limit errors (429) are handled gracefully
- Model not found errors (404) are explained
- JSON parsing errors are caught and logged

### 3. Deployment Documentation
- Created comprehensive deployment guide
- Included troubleshooting steps
- Added testing instructions
- Documented common issues and solutions

## Technical Details
- The issue was the edge function using `gpt-4o-mini` model which may not be available
- The new model `gpt-3.5-turbo-1106` is stable and supports JSON response format
- Error responses now properly return fallback recommendations
- All errors are logged for debugging

## Success Criteria: âœ…
- âœ… Edge function uses stable OpenAI model
- âœ… Better error handling implemented
- âœ… Fallback recommendations work when API fails
- âœ… Deployment documentation created

## Next Steps
1. **Deploy the updated edge function:**
   ```bash
   supabase functions deploy generate-recommendations
   ```

2. **Test the recommendations:**
   - Click the sparkles button to generate recommendations
   - Should work with valid OpenAI API key
   - Should show fallback recommendations if API fails

3. **Monitor logs if issues persist:**
   ```bash
   supabase functions logs generate-recommendations
   ```

## Important Notes
- The edge function now uses `gpt-3.5-turbo-1106` which is widely available
- If you still get errors, check your OpenAI API key permissions
- The fallback recommendations will always be shown if the API fails
