# Fix Detailed Analysis Auto-Update - 2025-05-30

## Overview
Fixed an issue where the Detailed Analysis section in the "All Reviews" tab doesn't automatically update when changing the business. Previously, users had to manually click the refresh button to update the data.

## Objectives
- Enable automatic update of Detailed Analysis when business selection changes
- Maintain the refresh button functionality for manual updates
- Ensure proper data flow through component hierarchy
- Fix caching issues preventing real-time updates

## Files Modified/Created

### üîÑ MODIFIED FILES:
- `src/pages/Dashboard.tsx` - Added selectedBusiness prop to DashboardContent component
- `src/components/dashboard/DashboardContent.tsx` - Added selectedBusiness prop and passed it to AllReviewsContent
- `src/components/dashboard/AllReviewsContent.tsx` - Added selectedBusiness prop and passed the actual business name to AnalysisSummary
- `src/components/analysis/AnalysisSummary.tsx` - Removed aggressive memoization cache, added business change detection
- `src/components/AllReviewsAiAnalysis.tsx` - Added logic to clear cache and re-fetch when reviews change

### üÜï NEW FILES:
- None

### üóëÔ∏è DELETED FILES:
- None

## Changes Made

### 1. Dashboard Component
- Modified the DashboardContent usage to include selectedBusiness prop
- Ensures the selected business is passed down through the component tree

### 2. DashboardContent Component
- Added selectedBusiness to the component props interface
- Set default value to "all" if not provided
- Passed the prop down to AllReviewsContent component

### 3. AllReviewsContent Component
- Added selectedBusiness to the component props interface
- Created logic to determine the display business name (handles "all" vs specific business)
- Replaced hardcoded "Current Business" with the actual selected business name in AnalysisSummary

### 4. AnalysisSummary Component (Major Fix)
- **Removed** aggressive `memoizeWithExpiry` caching that was preventing real-time updates
- **Added** business change detection using `useEffect` and `prevBusinessName` state
- **Modified** the analysis generation to use only React's `useMemo` for performance
- Filters are now reset when business changes

### 5. AllReviewsAiAnalysis Component
- **Added** `useRef` to track previous reviews
- **Modified** `useEffect` to detect when reviews change
- **Added** logic to clear analysis and cache when reviews change
- Ensures fresh analysis is generated for each business

## Technical Details
- The main issue was caused by two layers of caching:
  1. AnalysisSummary used `memoizeWithExpiry` with a 10-minute cache
  2. AllReviewsAiAnalysis didn't re-fetch when reviews changed
- The fix ensures proper cache invalidation when business changes
- React's built-in memoization is sufficient for performance
- No external cache is needed for real-time responsiveness

## Success Criteria: ‚úÖ
- ‚úÖ Detailed Analysis updates automatically when changing business
- ‚úÖ Review Summary updates automatically when changing business
- ‚úÖ All graphs and charts update in real-time
- ‚úÖ Refresh button remains functional
- ‚úÖ No regression in existing functionality
- ‚úÖ Performance remains optimized with React's memoization

## Next Steps
- Monitor for any edge cases with business name handling
- Consider implementing a context provider for business selection to avoid prop drilling in the future
- Test with all business types to ensure consistent behavior
- Consider adding loading states during business transitions
