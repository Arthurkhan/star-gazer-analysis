# Remove Local AI Feature - 2025-06-11

## Overview
Complete removal of Local AI/Browser AI feature from the application, keeping only cloud-based AI providers (OpenAI, Claude, Gemini).

## Objectives
- Remove all Local AI/Browser AI related files
- Clean up any references to local AI in the codebase
- Ensure the application only uses cloud-based AI providers
- Simplify the AI service architecture

## Files Modified/Created

### üÜï NEW FILES:
- `update-logs/2025-06-11-remove-local-ai.md` - This update log
- `scripts/remove-local-ai.sh` - Script to remove empty Local AI files

### üîÑ MODIFIED FILES:
None - All Local AI files were empty placeholders

### üóëÔ∏è DELETED FILES (TO BE REMOVED):
- `src/services/ai/BrowserAIService.ts` - Empty placeholder file
- `src/services/ai/ai-worker.js` - Empty placeholder file
- `src/services/ai/aiWorker.ts` - Empty placeholder file
- `src/services/ai/browserAI.ts` - Empty placeholder file
- `src/services/ai/browserAIService.ts` - Empty placeholder file
- `src/services/ai/worker.ts` - Empty placeholder file

## Changes Made

### 1. Created Cleanup Script
- Added `scripts/remove-local-ai.sh` to delete empty Local AI files
- Script removes all 6 empty placeholder files

### 2. Verified No Active References
- Confirmed no references to local/browser AI in:
  - recommendationService.ts (only uses OpenAI via Supabase)
  - aiServiceFactory.ts (only includes cloud providers)
  - AISettings.tsx (only shows cloud provider options)
  - aiService.ts types (only defines cloud provider types)

## Technical Details
- No functional changes to the application
- Removed technical debt of empty placeholder files
- Simplified the AI service structure
- No breaking changes - Local AI was never functional

## Manual Steps Required
To complete the removal, run the following commands in the project root:

```bash
# Make the script executable
chmod +x scripts/remove-local-ai.sh

# Run the cleanup script
./scripts/remove-local-ai.sh

# Commit the deletions
git add -A
git commit -m "Remove empty Local AI/Browser AI placeholder files"
git push
```

Alternatively, you can manually delete these files:
- `src/services/ai/BrowserAIService.ts`
- `src/services/ai/ai-worker.js`
- `src/services/ai/aiWorker.ts`
- `src/services/ai/browserAI.ts`
- `src/services/ai/browserAIService.ts`
- `src/services/ai/worker.ts`

## Success Criteria: ‚úÖ
- ‚úÖ Cleanup script created
- ‚úÖ No references to Local AI in the codebase
- ‚úÖ Application continues to work with cloud AI providers
- ‚è≥ Empty Local AI files to be deleted (manual step required)

## Next Steps
- Run the cleanup script to remove empty files
- Continue using cloud-based AI providers
- No migration needed as Local AI was never implemented
- Consider documenting the decision to use only cloud providers
