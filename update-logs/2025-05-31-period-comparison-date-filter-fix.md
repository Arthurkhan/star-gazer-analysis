# Period Comparison Date Filtering Fix - 2025-05-31

## Overview
Fixed the period comparison feature to properly filter reviews by date range at the database level, supporting both legacy and normalized table structures. The main issue was that date-filtered queries were replacing the entire dataset instead of temporarily filtering it.

## Objectives
- Fix date filtering that was returning all 1385 reviews regardless of date range
- Support legacy business-named tables with proper SQL date filtering
- Maintain backward compatibility with normalized table structure
- Ensure period comparison shows correct data for selected time periods
- Preserve the full dataset while allowing temporary date filtering

## Files Modified/Created

### ðŸ†• NEW FILES:
- `src/services/legacyReviewService.ts` - New service for handling legacy table queries with date filtering

### ðŸ”„ MODIFIED FILES:
- `src/hooks/useDashboardData.ts` - Updated to detect and support both legacy and normalized table structures with temporary filtering

## Changes Made

### 1. Legacy Review Service
- Created `fetchLegacyReviewsWithDateFilter` function that properly applies date filtering at the SQL level
- Added automatic detection of the correct date column name (`publishedAtDate` vs `publishedatdate`)
- Implemented `checkTableExists` to detect if legacy tables are in use
- Added `fetchAllLegacyReviewsWithDateFilter` to fetch from multiple legacy tables with date range support
- Included detailed logging to help debug date filtering issues

### 2. Dashboard Data Hook Enhancement
- **Key Fix**: Added temporary filtered reviews state (`tempFilteredReviews`) to avoid replacing the main dataset
- Added automatic detection of database structure (legacy vs normalized)
- Modified `loadAllData` to:
  - Load all data on initial mount
  - Store date-filtered results separately when date parameters are provided
  - Preserve the full dataset in `allReviews`
- Updated `filteredReviews` memoization to use temporary filtered data when available
- Fixed date filtering to work at database level instead of client-side

## Technical Details
- **Issue**: Date filtering was replacing the entire `allReviews` state with filtered data
- **Root Cause**: When `refreshData` was called with date parameters, it overwrote the main dataset
- **Solution**: 
  - Implemented separate state for temporary date-filtered results
  - Maintained the full dataset in `allReviews` 
  - Used `tempFilteredReviews` for date-specific queries
  - Applied SQL date filtering using `gte` and `lte` operators

## Success Criteria: âœ…
- âœ… Date filtering now works at database level
- âœ… Period comparison shows correct review counts for each period
- âœ… Full dataset is preserved when applying date filters
- âœ… Both legacy and normalized table structures are supported
- âœ… No breaking changes to existing functionality

## Next Steps
- Test the period comparison feature with the debug tool
- Verify that different date ranges return appropriate review counts
- Monitor performance with large datasets
- Consider migrating legacy tables to normalized structure in the future
- Remove debug tab once period comparison is verified working
