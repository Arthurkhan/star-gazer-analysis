### Completed Improvements
1. **AI Implementation Consolidation**
   - Fixed BrowserAIService implementation with proper worker integration
   - Consolidated AI worker implementations into a single file (worker.ts)
   - Enhanced error handling and circuit breaker pattern for AI requests
   - Added better response structure with more specific outputs

2. **Business Type Management**
   - Created consistent BusinessMappings.ts to ensure proper handling of business types
   - Added utility functions for business type detection and mapping

3. **Performance Optimizations**
   - Added VirtualizedReviewList component using react-virtual for efficient rendering
   - Implemented safe data access utilities to prevent common "Cannot read property" errors
   - Enhanced error reporting and debugging capabilities

4. **Database Migration Improvements**
   - Added a UI component for database schema migration
   - Enhanced migration logic with better error handling
   - Improved consistency between legacy and new database schema

### Next Steps
1. Complete React Query implementation for global state management
2. Implement PDF export functionality
3. Create email notification system
4. Add period comparison analytics feature
5. Enhance dashboard with additional visualizations

## 2025-05-21: Performance Optimization and Code Cleanup

### Analysis Summary
- Identified database schema transition from one-table-per-business to normalized schema
- Found inefficient data loading patterns causing UI slowdowns
- Detected lack of proper pagination in frontend components
- Identified client-side AI processing blocking the main thread
- Found inconsistent use of caching strategies

### Completed Improvements
1. **Database & Data Fetching Optimization**
   - Updated `reviewDataService.ts` to properly handle both legacy and new normalized database schemas
   - Implemented consistent pagination for all data fetching operations with `fetchPaginatedReviews`
   - Added proper error handling and progress tracking for large datasets
   - Optimized caching mechanism to reduce unnecessary database calls

2. **UI Rendering Optimization**
   - Created `VirtualizedReviewList` component using react-virtual for efficient rendering of large lists
   - Added support for incremental "Load More" data loading with indicators
   - Implemented skeleton loading states for better user experience

3. **AI Processing Optimization**
   - Moved browser-based AI processing to Web Workers to prevent main thread blocking
   - Added `aiProcessing.worker.ts` to handle intensive computations off the main thread
   - Created new `browserAIService` with proper worker communication and fallback mechanisms
   - Implemented request queuing with timeouts to prevent hanging operations

4. **Dashboard Data Management**
   - Refactored `useDashboardData` hook to use the new pagination system
   - Added proper states for tracking loading, errors, and pagination
   - Optimized data filtering and business selection logic
   - Added support for date range filtering at the database level
