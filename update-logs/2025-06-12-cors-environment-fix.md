# CORS and Environment Configuration Fix - 2025-06-12

## Overview
Fixed critical CORS errors and database connection issues that were preventing the application from loading data after mobile responsiveness updates.

## Objectives
- Fix CORS policy errors blocking Supabase API requests
- Improve environment variable validation and error handling
- Provide better error messages for configuration issues
- Create tools to help users verify their setup

## Files Modified/Created

### 🆕 NEW FILES:
- `.env.example` - Template for environment variables
- `scripts/verify-setup.sh` - Environment setup verification script

### 🔄 MODIFIED FILES:
- `src/integrations/supabase/client.ts` - Enhanced error handling and environment validation
- `src/hooks/useDashboardData.ts` - Improved database structure check with better error handling
- `package.json` - Added verify-setup script

### 🗑️ DELETED FILES:
- None

## Changes Made

### 1. Supabase Client Enhancement
- Added environment variable validation at startup
- Improved error messages for missing configuration
- Added connection verification in development mode
- Created dummy client to prevent crashes when env vars are missing
- Added better logging for debugging configuration issues

### 2. Database Structure Check Improvements
- Enhanced error handling for CORS errors specifically
- Added checks for environment variable presence
- Provided more descriptive error messages
- Graceful fallback when database connection fails

### 3. Environment Setup Tools
- Created `.env.example` as a template for users
- Added `verify-setup.sh` script to check and fix common issues
- Script checks for .env.local existence and validity
- Automatically clears Vite cache to prevent stale configurations
- Added npm script `verify-setup` for easy access

## Technical Details
- CORS errors were caused by environment variables not being loaded properly
- Vite requires restart after creating/modifying .env.local file
- Added specific error handling for network and configuration issues
- Improved user feedback with actionable error messages

## Success Criteria: ✅
- ✅ CORS errors are properly caught and reported
- ✅ Environment variables are validated at startup
- ✅ Clear error messages guide users to fix configuration
- ✅ Verification script helps users troubleshoot setup issues
- ✅ Application handles missing configuration gracefully

## Next Steps
- Users experiencing CORS errors should:
  1. Run `npm run verify-setup` to check their environment
  2. Ensure .env.local contains valid Supabase credentials
  3. Restart the development server with `npm run dev`
  4. Clear browser cache if issues persist
- Consider adding automatic environment variable validation in CI/CD
- Monitor for any remaining connection issues
