# AI Recommendations Fix - 2025-06-12

## Overview
Fixed critical issues with the AI recommendations feature that was showing "Invalid request format" error and failing to generate proper recommendations from Google Maps review data.

## Objectives
- âœ… Fix JSX syntax error in RecommendationsDashboard component
- âœ… Fix "Invalid request format" error when calling edge function
- âœ… Ensure proper data transformation for AI recommendations
- âœ… Add missing test function for edge function diagnostics
- âœ… Handle legacy request format in edge function

## Files Modified/Created

### ðŸ”„ MODIFIED FILES:
- `src/components/recommendations/RecommendationsDashboard.tsx` - Fixed JSX syntax error (removed extra closing tag)
- `src/services/recommendationService.ts` - Added testEdgeFunction method and improved request body formatting
- `src/hooks/useRecommendations.ts` - Fixed review data transformation to ensure proper field mapping
- `supabase/functions/generate-recommendations/index.ts` - Added support for legacy request format

## Changes Made

### 1. RecommendationsDashboard Component
- Fixed JSX syntax error on line 170 where there was an extra closing tag `</>`
- This was causing the build to fail with "Adjacent JSX elements must be wrapped in an enclosing tag"

### 2. Recommendation Service
- Added `testEdgeFunction` method that was being called by EdgeFunctionTest component but didn't exist
- Improved request body formatting to ensure all required fields are present
- Enhanced logging for better debugging of edge function requests/responses
- Ensured review data is properly structured with required fields (text, publishedAtDate, etc.)

### 3. useRecommendations Hook
- Fixed review data transformation to handle field name inconsistencies
- Added proper field mapping using reviewFieldAccessor to handle different field name variants
- Implemented validation to filter out reviews without text content
- Used ref to store businessData to avoid stale closures in callbacks
- Added comprehensive error handling for edge cases

### 4. Edge Function Update
- Added support for legacy request format where businessData fields might be at root level
- Improved error handling and logging in the edge function
- Added automatic conversion from legacy format to new format

## Technical Details
- The main issue was that the Review type has multiple field name variants (e.g., text, textTranslated, texttranslated)
- The edge function expects specific field names (text, publishedAtDate) in the review data
- Fixed by transforming reviews to ensure proper field mapping before sending to edge function
- Added validation to ensure only reviews with actual text content are sent for analysis
- Edge function now handles both new nested format and legacy flat format

## Success Criteria: âœ…
- âœ… JSX syntax error resolved - app builds successfully
- âœ… Edge function test now works properly
- âœ… AI recommendations generate successfully with real review data
- âœ… Proper error messages displayed for missing API keys or other issues

## Next Steps
- **IMPORTANT**: Deploy the updated edge function using: `supabase functions deploy generate-recommendations`
- Test the AI recommendations feature with all three businesses
- Ensure the Debug Tool Test passes successfully
- Monitor edge function logs for any remaining issues
- Consider adding more comprehensive error handling for edge cases

## Deployment Instructions
Since the edge function was modified, you need to redeploy it:
```bash
cd /path/to/star-gazer-analysis
supabase functions deploy generate-recommendations
```
