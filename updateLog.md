// Chart type toggle functionality
const [chartType, setChartType] = useState<\"line\" | \"area\">(\"area\");

// Data visualization with cumulative field
<Line dataKey=\"cumulativeCount\" name=\"Total Reviews\" />
<Area dataKey=\"cumulativeCount\" name=\"Total Reviews\" />
```

**Layout Integration**: Clean separation in OverviewSection
```typescript
{/* Charts section */}
<div className=\"space-y-6\">
  {/* Reviews Timeline Chart */}
  <ReviewsChart data={monthlyData} />
  
  {/* Cumulative Reviews Growth Chart */}
  <CumulativeReviewsChart data={monthlyData} />
</div>
```

**Color Differentiation Strategy**:

## 2025-05-21: Fixed Circular Dependencies Causing Infinite Loop

### Root Cause Analysis
After careful investigation, we identified the core issue causing the infinite loop:

1. **Circular Dependency Cycle**:
   - `useDashboardData` ➡️ passed `reviewData` to ➡️ `useBusinessSelection`
   - `useBusinessSelection` had an effect that triggered on `reviewData` changes
   - This effect updated `businessData` using `setBusinessData`
   - `fetchNextPage` in `useDashboardData` depended on `setBusinessData` and `reviewData`
   - When `fetchNextPage` updated `reviewData`, it triggered the whole cycle again

2. **Cascading State Updates**:
   - Every business selection change triggered a data fetch
   - Every data fetch updated `reviewData`
   - Updated `reviewData` triggered `useBusinessSelection` effects
   - Which then triggered more state updates and re-renders

3. **Missing Safeguards**:
   - No proper reference tracking to prevent concurrent fetches
   - No dependency control in critical effect hooks
   - Excessive auto-pagination triggering recursive data fetches

### Completed Improvements
